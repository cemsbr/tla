To run the Ep you need maven 3. To run do this:

1 - Enter ep2 dir
2 - Run the command 'mvn package'
3 - Run Ep typing 'haddop jar target/tla-1.0-job.jar <filtered application log> <haddop input path with bzip2 files> <haddop output path>'

Caution: The command above will erase the output dir if it exists!!!

For filtered log you can use 'files/filtered_log'
For input path you can use 'files/input_path'

You can have a coffee. The execution will take a while.
